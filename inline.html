      There are three main types of web development: front-end, back-end and full-stack.

Web development broadly encompasses the whole of a website's functionality, but the work itself is often broken down into three types: 

Front-end development is responsible for the aspects of a website that users see and interact with: the user interface (UI). Front-end developers are well-versed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, often working closely with design and UX teams to capture both the intended look and feel of the site, while also creating a quality user experience across multiple device types.

Back-end development is responsible for all the aspects of a website that users do not see. This is also known as server-side development because back-end developers focus primarily on the behind-the-scenes logic, APIs and database interactions that power the site. 

Full-stack development is a more holistic approach where the developers responsible for the site or app take care of the entire development stack, from the inner workings typically performed on the back-end to the presentation layer normally handled by front-end developers.

Front-End vs. Back-End Development: Which Should You Prioritize?

 

What Does a Web Developer Do?
Web developers develop websites, specifically by creating the site’s code, connecting it to a server and maintaining its accessibility to users.

Web development is responsible for creating the sites and applications we use through a web browser in our day-to-day lives. Web developers, often working in teams or alongside other tech professionals like data scientists, UX designers and product managers, use specialized techniques and a thorough knowledge of one or more programming languages to create a foundation for where the website’s database will live, known as a back-end. 

The back-end is dependent upon the website’s server, which stores web pages and applications to be loaded into the web browser upon request.  The server acts as an intermediary between the web page or application and the data stored within the server, facilitating communication between the database and the client.

Web developers are also responsible for creating the front-end of a website through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which creates the layout and style that the user sees and interacts with when using the site.

Finally, web developers are responsible for maintaining the site's functionality and overall performance over time.

 

Is Web Development a Good Career? 
According to the latest U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average salary for a web developer is $78,000, and positions are expected to grow 13 percent from 2020 to 2030, faster than the average for other occupations.
